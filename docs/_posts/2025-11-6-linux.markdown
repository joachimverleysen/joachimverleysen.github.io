Linux. If you know something about computers, you might have heard of it.
It's the thing that the nerds use. Because it's "better". Well in this post 
I'll try to explain what Linux is. And also why it is indeed better than Windows and Mac.

Most people would say that Linux is an 'operating system', just like Windows and Mac OS.
And... that's not exactly true. Let me explain.
In the 1970's Dennis Ritchie and Ken Thompson made Unix, an operating system that was pretty good.
It was not free and could only run on specific machines.

Some time later, Richard Stallman started GNU. A project to make free software, including 
a Unix-like operating system that is free.

In the 1990's Linus Torvalds made Linux, a kernel. Together with GNU, it can function as a complete operating system. When we use Linux on a desktop, the operating system is actually GNU/Linux. Linux is a kernel, not an operating system.
