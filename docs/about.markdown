Hi there, it's Joachim. I'm a compsci student from Belgium and on this site I'm mostly 
going to be yapping about computers, in the form of blog posts.

- Interested in my Github page (probably not)? Then check out this amazing URL.
Did you know you can click on it? (don't do it though)
[My Github][my-gh]

- No seriously don't click on that link

- By the way, if you want to blog like me, this framework that I use is called Jekyll.
It's customizable and cooler than Wordpress. You can check it out here:
[Jekyll][jekyll-gh]

[my-gh] : https://github.com/joachimverleysen
[jekyll-gh]: https://github.com/jekyll
